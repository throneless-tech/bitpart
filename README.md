# Bitpart

Bitpart is a messaging tool that runs on top of Signal to support activists, journalists, and human rights defenders.

## Building

This repository contains three components: the Bitpart server, a command-line client for connecting to the Bitpart server, and a storage adapter used for storing Signal key information to Bitpart's database. In order to build all three components, make sure you have a 2024 edition of Rust and run:

```
  cargo build
```
